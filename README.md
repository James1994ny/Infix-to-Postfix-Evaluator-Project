# Infix-to-Postfix-Evaluator-Project

This Java project functions as an evaluator for Infix notation. 
The program that solves and evaluates arithmetic expressions from infix notation to postfix notation by implementing stacks and queues to sort operators and operands, in which a binary expression tree is created and iterated through to have its values pushed onto a new stack to be evaluated.

Text file "Project3.txt" is where all infix expressions are placed. They are ordered in rows.
